Both projects 0 and 1 have been a very pleasant experience. This is the first time I use an IDE for Python which was 
Pycharm. To be honest I found PyCharm a bit challenging, but I understand it was my first time, and it takes years to 
really get to know a program properly. It was my first time too using Git/GitHub, committing and pushing and I found it
very smooth and nice, I like the concept behind GitHub because as far as I understood, the role of a Computer Scientist
is to put many parts (from different places) together to create a new piece of code and share it so another programmer 
can do the same etc. I love that idea because collaboration among people is what makes us great as humans. Coding wise I 
can not deny it was a bit confusing at the beginning, but it is a matter of practice. I am quite optimistic about GitHub
and PyCharm in the future, I know I will use them in the future.
